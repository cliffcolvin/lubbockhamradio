Thank you for your continued support and participation in our West Texas Pathfinders GMRS Net. We are thrilled to announce that the generosity of our community members, like Kevin Bolen, is helping us enhance our emergency network.

Mark your calendars for January, as we kick off the new year with another exciting opportunity for our dedicated members. Tune in to our GMRS Net for a chance to win the Mac Tools 32 piece ratcheting bit set donated by Kevin. It's not just about the holiday season; we are committed to keeping the spirit of giving alive throughout the year.

We can't wait to see you all in January and look forward to another fantastic year of supporting our emergency network. Wishing you a safe and joyful holiday season!

Warm regards,
