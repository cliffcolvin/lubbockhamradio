# Lubbock County ARES Net Announcement

Beginning Monday November 13, 2023 we will no longer have a separate net for Lubbock County ARES. The net will merge with the district RACES/ARES net on KZ5JOE 444.450 +5 114.8 at 8:30pm local time. This will accomplish a couple of goals. 
1. Bring the wider community into our weekly net.
2. Allow for expansion of the GMRS net which is now regularly meeting longer than 1hr.

73 and see you at 8:30pm Monday!
